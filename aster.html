            <h2>Aster flower</h2>
            <p>Asteraceae
             large family of flowering plants
             The family Asteraceae or Compositae (the aster, daisy, or sunflower family) is the largest family of flowering plants. It has the most species.
             What looks like its flower is really made of hundreds or thousands of tiny individual flowers. The technical term for it is a pseudanthium ("false flower").
             The driving force for the evolution of the Asteraceae was that the composite flowers look attractive to pollinating insects. A large brightly coloured flower attracts insects. The other quality insects like is the scent of the pollen and the sugary nectar in the flowers. The asters are very successful (over 32,000 known species of flowering plants in over 1,900 genera in the order Asterales). Their success is due to what they offer to visiting insects. It is also due to their ability to grow almost anywhere, but especially on grass.
